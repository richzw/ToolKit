- Tips
  - AI is the fastest way to forget how to code and how to think.
    - If AI is doing the thinking for you, your skills are getting worse... fast.
    - If AI is helping you think better, you’re still learning.
  - Use it as a reviewer, a rubber duck, a teacher. Not as an author:
    - Explain the decisions behind a piece of code
    - Explain the style and conventions
    - Ask whether your code is good enough, simple enough
    - Ask about edge cases you might have missed
    - Ask for trade-offs, not just answers
    - Ask for alternative implementations, then compare
    - Ask for tests, not production code: "What tests would give me confidence this works?"
    - Ask it to review, not generate
    - Ask it to explain errors you already hit
    - Ask it to challenge your assumptions
